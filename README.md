<h1>My Movie List</h1>
My Movie List is an android application that allows a user to create a movie and add it to a list. <br>
This app is for users who would like to make a watchlist for all of the movies they want to see. <br>
The app features the ability to create movies, update and delete them as well as view them as a part of their list.<br>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
I used Android Studio and Kotlin to program this app.<br>
I made use of the google maps api to let the user store the location of where their movie was filmed.<br>
I used Adobe Photoshop to create the icon for the app.<br>
